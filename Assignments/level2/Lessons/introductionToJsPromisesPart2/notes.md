# Promise
    * Promises are for handling asynchronous code
    * A Javascript Constructor:   new Promise()
    * Promises are eager.

    * three states for promises.
        *   all promises start in the <pending> state.
        *   a promise ends up as either resolved. .then()
        *   If a promise does not end up as resolved    
            it becomes a rejected status.   .catch().

GitHub is a control system: a place on-line where you can save or upload and download your information to for future or current use. Also it is a good repository for storing samples of 
your coding projects that you can share with your employer or potential employer to view for examples of your work.

when uploading data or code to git hub you use the following commands.
git add -A   : this allows you for get your file ready for uploading to GitHub.
git commit -m "notes are needed and put here in parenthesis related to your code. I use the date at then end of my line so I know when I last saved and updated my code, in case I need to use it
    and I dont have to try and figure out which version I completed last. I am going to also time stamp it. in case I do several updates in a single day.
